You can load up the site [here](https://manga-tracker-kb.herokuapp.com)!

To start your tracking journey you first need to sign in on the top right of the screen to get access to the rest of the web app!
After you sign in you will be sent to all your Mangas you have added.
Since you are new and don't have any added yet; you will click "ADD MANGA" in the nav bar. You will fill out the info the best to your knowledge ( do not worry if u cant fill out everything at first you can always update it later ! ), then hit "Add Manga" button at the bottom of the list under "Notes". Once its created you will be sent back to your list! you can click on "DETAILS" next to the title to view the Manga and you can Update it from there!

Have fun tracking and collecting Manga!!

# Next Steps
***

In the future I would like to add more to the Manga Tracker. I am hoping when I have more free time I can come back and implement these items and amplify my Manga Tracker.

Here is the list:

- Making it where you can sort you All Manga list by: ABC, Currently Reading, Completed, Plan to Read, Dropped, and/or Publisher.
- Letting you add images to each Manga to show in Details.
